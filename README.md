# Calculator 1 is called Many Moons!
This calculator calculates the approximate number of moons that have risen in a person's life!
The calculation excludes Blue Moons (the 13th moon that sometimes occurs and calculates using birth month not birth date.)
I used Python 3.7.9 to write Many Moons
Have fun!
